The [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in/) project is part of the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India.\\
[Osdag](https://osdag.fossee.in/) is a cross-platform free/libre and open-source software for the design (and detailing) of steel structures, following the Indian Standard IS 800:2007. 

Below I have added the images of the module - `Flexural member` and it's sub-modules: `Simply Supported Beam`, `Cantilever Beam` and `Other Beam Supports`

Images for the Simply Supported Beam sub-module. On the left, you can see the main page. Middle, is the Design Preference pop-up with the description of Column Section. Right, is another pop-up for the Design Preference with the description of Optimization tab. This is done so that user gets better control over the design based on their input from the input dock.

The Design output of the file is accessible [here](https://rutvikjoshi63.github.io/assets/pdf/FlexureModuleExample.pdf)

The code is simple. Checkout `Osdag` and dowload it, don't worry it's free and open-source, checkout the Github pages(read more about the <a href="https://github.com/osdag-admin/Osdag">`Osdag - Github`</a> system).
The code for the above images is available at my [Github page](https://github.com/rutvikjoshi63/Osdag/tree/dev)
